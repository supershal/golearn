# Graph

# Properties
 - traversal DFS, BFS

# DFS
  visite node and then recursively its children

# BFS
 Visit node and their children. add them to queue.

 # Intresting problems
 - Build order depedency
 - minimum distance between two points
 - find a node which has minimum distance to all target node given obstacles. ex. Shortest Distance from All Buildings (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-from-all-buildings/)
